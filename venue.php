					<h2> Project Synopsis</h2>
					<p> Environmental monitoring and management has received much attention recently.
						Owing to a paradigm shift toward advancement in technology, an Integrated Information System,  
						combining Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing, Big-Data analytics is hugely 
						considered valuable. The technological advancements in the field of automation 
						has aided our everyday life with comfort and ease. The proliferation of these devices in a
						communicatingâ€“actuating network creates the Internet of Things, wherein sensors
						and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared
						across platforms in order to develop a common operating picture. <br><br>

						As a major application field of IoT, waste management has become one such issue.
						The absence of efficient waste management has caused serious environment al problems and cost issues.

					<p> The E-Garbage Monitoring system is a very innovative system which will help
					to keep the cities clean by monitoring and constantly informing about the level
					of garbage collected in the garbage bins. This system monitors the garbage bins
					and provide details about the level of garbage collected in the garbage bins to a
					web page. Multi-sensors and Web services are used to collect data - including the
					surrounding humidity, and to detect and compare the garbage level with the depth
					of the filled bins. A Wi-Fi modem is attached therewith to constantly send the data
					over the webpage, whilst buzzer act as a signaling device to inform, when the level
					of garbage collected crosses the set limit.

							<p> This is not an original idea, for the implementation of smart garbage bin;
							the idea has existed for many years, after the IoT field finding its grip in our lives.
							This is, however an original plan for designing a smart garbage bin with the help of a 
							NodeMCU Unit, which holds an inbuilt Wi-Fi module. Other additional components are
							the ultrasonic sensors, some connecting wires, integration of Apixu weather API for commecting
							weather details and Amcharts Javascript Libraries for providing graphical details of the bins.
